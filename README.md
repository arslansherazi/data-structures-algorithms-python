# Data Structures and Algorithms
## Data Structures
### Stack
### Queue
### Linked List
## Tree
- Binary Tree
- Binary Search Tree (BST)
- Heap
- AVL tree
### Graph
### Hashing
### Recursion

## Algorithms
### Searching Algorithms
### Sorting Algorithms
### Greedy Algorithms
### Dynamic Programming
~~~
Divide the problem into smallest possible sub-problems and remember the results of sub-problems and use
the results in other overlapping or related sub-problems. Mainly used for optimization of the problem
~~~
### Divide and Conquer
~~~
Divide the problem into smallest possible sub-problems and solve every sub-problem independently
and merge all the sub-problems
~~~
### Backtracking
## Analysis of Algorithms
### Time Complexity
- #### Best Case
-  #### Average Case
- #### Worst Case
### Space Complexity
