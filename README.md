- Binary Tree
- Binary Search Tree (BST)
- Heap
- AVL tree
### Graph
### Hashing
### Recursion

## Algorithms
### Searching Algorithms
### Sorting Algorithms
### Greedy Algorithms
~~~
- Mainly used for optimization of the problem

- the closest solution that seems to provide an optimum solution is chosen.

- Greedy algorithms try to find a localized optimum solution, which may eventually 
  lead to globally optimized solutions. However, gnerally greedy algorithms do not 
  provide globally optimized solutions.
~~~
### Dynamic Programming
~~~
- Divide the problem into smallest possible sub-problems and remember the results of 
  sub-problems and use the results in other overlapping or related sub-problems.
   
- Mainly used for optimization of the problem
~~~
### Divide and Conquer
~~~
Divide the problem into smallest possible sub-problems and solve every sub-problem independently
and merge all the sub-problems
~~~
### Backtracking
## Analysis of Algorithms
### Time Complexity
- #### Best Case
-  #### Average Case
- #### Worst Case
