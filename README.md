# Data Structures and Algorithms
## Data Structures
### Stack
### Queue
### Linked List
## Tree
- Binary Tree
- Binary Search Tree (BST)
- Heap
### AVL tree
~~~
Balancing Factor = (Height of left sub-tree - Height of right sub-tree)
~~~
~~~
Balancing factor should be 1 otherwise balance the tree
~~~
### Graph
### Hashing
### Recursion

## Algorithms
### Searching Algorithms
### Sorting Algorithms
### Greedy Algorithms
~~~
- Mainly used for optimization of the problem

- the closest solution that seems to provide an optimum solution is chosen.

- Greedy algorithms try to find a localized optimum solution, which may eventually 
  lead to globally optimized solutions. However, gnerally greedy algorithms do not 
  provide globally optimized solutions.
~~~
### Dynamic Programming
~~~
- Divide the problem into smallest possible sub-problems and remember the results of 
  sub-problems and use the results in other overlapping or related sub-problems.
   
- Mainly used for optimization of the problem
~~~
### Divide and Conquer
~~~
Divide the problem into smallest possible sub-problems and solve every sub-problem independently
and merge all the sub-problems
~~~
### Backtracking
~~~
general algorithmic technique that considers searching every possible combination 
in order to solve a computational problem and backtrack to find next combination
if any combination fails to satisfy the constraints of the problem 
at any point of time
~~~
